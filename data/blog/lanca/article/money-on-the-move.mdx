Blockchain bridges are like pathways that connect different blockchain networks, letting people move digital treasures—like money or information—between them. Picture a bunch of separate islands, each with its own special treasures. These islands are the blockchain networks, and each one works differently: some are fast, some keep things private, and others are built for specific jobs. This variety is exciting because it sparks new ideas, but it also means treasures get stuck on their own islands. For example, if you have tokens on an island called Ethereum, you can't use them on another island like Arbitrum or Polygon without a bridge to take them across. 

Bridges make this possible, helping people use their treasures in new ways, like in decentralised finance (DeFi), where assets need to move freely between networks. In March 2025, according to DefiLlama, over $633 million worth of treasures crossed these bridges in just one day, showing how much people rely on them.

But bridges come with some big challenges. First, they can be wasteful, tying up a lot of money in ways that don't always make sense. Second, they're often confusing to use, with every bridge working a bit differently, which can leave people unsure or frustrated. Third, building new bridges takes a long time, slowing down how fast we can connect more islands. And finally, security is a huge worry—bridges can be attacked, and if they fail, people might lose their treasures. This makes some hesitant to trust them.

Even with these problems, bridges are super important for connecting the blockchain world together. People are working hard to make them safer, simpler, and more efficient, so everyone can enjoy the full benefits of blockchain technology without the headaches, and we, at Lanca, are all in this together.

## Key Operational Challenges of Traditional Blockchain Bridges

As aforementioned, bridges are useful. However, these bridges have some big problems that make them hard to use and less effective than they should. Let's look at main operational issues of the current bridge that we are facing.

### Inefficiency In Using Money

One major problem with traditional bridges is that they need to hold a lot of money to work. For example, if you want to move $1 million from one blockchain to another, the bridge has to keep $1 million locked up on both sides. It's like a store having to keep a huge stack of cash in its safe just to let you buy something—it's a waste because that money can't be used for anything else. This also makes the bridge a target for hackers who want to steal all that locked-up cash. As more blockchain networks pop up, this issue gets worse because each new connection needs even more money tied up, which isn't practical or safe for the future.

### Confusing to Use

Using these bridges can feel like a puzzle. Every bridge has its own rules: some charge small fees, like 0.05% of what you're moving, while others charge more, like 0.3%, and sometimes extra costs sneak in because of tricky things like “slippage.” Plus, the time it takes to move your stuff can vary a lot—sometimes it's quick, just a few seconds, and other times it drags on for hours. It's like using different apps to send money where each one has a different price and speed, and sometimes you have to swap your cash into another type first. This mess makes it tough for people, especially those new to blockchain, to figure out what's going on and trust the process.

### Slow to Connect New Networks

The blockchain world moves fast, with new networks showing up all the time to make things better, like speeding up transactions or cutting costs. But traditional bridges can't keep up. It can take weeks or even months for them to connect to these new networks, so people have to wait before they can use them. Imagine a new shop opening in your neighborhood, but you can't use your credit card there for months—that's what this feels like. In a place like blockchain, where being quick can give you an edge, this slowness means missing out on new possibilities, which frustrates users who want to jump in right away.

## Security Problems in Moving Assets Between Blockchains

When it comes to moving digital assets, security is the biggest worry for traditional bridges. These bridges have weak spots that hackers can hit, leading to huge losses and making people unsure about trusting them. Past disasters have shown just how bad these risks can get.

### Centralised Weak Points

A lot of these bridges depend on a central part—like one key person or system—to make the transfers happen. If that part gets hacked, the whole bridge collapses. It's like having one big lock on a treasure chest that everyone knows how to pick. In 2022, the Ronin bridge got robbed of over $625 million because hackers broke into its central system. This setup goes against what blockchains are supposed to be—spread out and safe—and leaves users open to dangers that a more scattered system could avoid.

### Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

Bridges use computer programs called smart contracts to manage moving things from one blockchain to another. These programs are complicated, and if there's a mistake in them, hackers can cause chaos. Back in 2022, The Verge said bridge hacks cost over $1 billion, with examples like Wormhole and Poly showing how tiny errors can lose big money. Many reputation auditor stressed that these programs need to be rock-solid to protect the stuff they hold, but their trickiness often leads to slip-ups. Since bridges deal with valuable transfers, even small flaws can mean major theft, so checking them carefully is super important but tough to do.

### Faking Messages Between Blockchains

Bridges send messages between blockchains to say what needs to move, but if those messages aren't double-checked properly, hackers can fake them. This could let them make extra digital money or steal what's there. Chainlink's guide on bridge risks explains how this trickery can swipe assets, especially since different blockchains don't always agree on how to verify stuff. Without tough rules to make sure messages are real, bridges stay open to attacks that ruin their reliability.

### Big Money Piles Draw Hackers

Traditional bridges need to keep huge amounts of money locked up to work, and that's like waving a flag for hackers to come steal it. Big wins, like the Ronin hack, have added up to billions lost by 2025 — CoinCodex says about 40% of Web3 hacks this year hit bridges because of this. It's a high-stakes game that makes bridges tempting targets, scaring off users who don't want to lose everything.

### Not Checking Messages Right

If a bridge doesn't make sure money is locked up on one side before letting it out on the other, hackers can trick it into doubling the money. Chainlink pointed out this flaw, saying bridges need careful steps to check everything, but it's hard to do that across blockchains that work differently. This mess ups the chance of scams, making people trust these transfers even less.

These security troubles aren't just ideas—they've hit hard in the real world and keep affecting how blockchains work together. Even though $633.56 million flows through bridges every day, people still worry about safety because of past hacks and ongoing concerns they talk about on Twitter's crypto chats. Everyone wants to use bridges, but they need to feel sure their money and data won't get stolen.

## How Lanca Solves the Problems of Blockchain Bridges

People have clear ideas about what they want from blockchain bridges: they should be safe, cheap, quick, and easy to use. Safety comes first—users want strong protections like a group of people making decisions together, multiple approvals for big moves, and regular checkups to keep their digital stuff secure. They're looking for bridges to feel as simple and trustworthy as the regular banking they're used to, which pushes companies to come up with better ways to make this happen. 

Lanca is going to step up with its new Lanca Bridging Framework (LBF), a fresh approach that tackles these problems head-on. It uses a smart dual system, a clever setup with a main pool and smaller ones, and a flexible way to keep money flowing where it's needed. The next section dives into how Lanca fixes these issues and explains its key benefits in a way that's straightforward, giving a clear picture that's easy to grasp even if you only know a little about blockchain technology.

### Fixing the Problem of Wasting Money

Traditional blockchain bridges waste money by locking up large amounts on every network to move digital tokens, leaving them idle instead of useful elsewhere. Lanca changes this with a smart new setup called the parent-child pool system. It has one main hub, called the Parent Pool, on the master blockchain, which acts like a central bank. This hub connects to smaller pools, called Child Pools, spread across different blockchains. Instead of locking up equal amounts everywhere, the Parent Pool sends money to these Child Pools only where it's needed, thanks to a secure messaging system called Concero Messaging V2 that keeps everything running smoothly. 

Lanca also uses a clever “IOU” system with helpers called Rebalancing Agents. These agents watch the Child Pools, and if one starts running low on money—making transfers tricky—they add some of their own cash. In return, they get an “I owe you” note, which they can cash in later when the Parent Pool shares out more money. This way, Lanca keeps less money locked up overall and uses it smarter, making transfers faster and cheaper.

### Making Things Easier for Users

Using traditional blockchain bridges can be a real pain. People moving their stuff between blockchains face a mess of different fees, wait times that jump from seconds to hours, and confusing steps that change depending on the networks. This chaos frustrates users and makes them doubt these bridges. 

Lanca fixes this by making the whole process simple and predictable. With the Lanca Bridging Framework, users don't have to worry about the complicated details of different blockchains—they just pick what they want to move or get, and Lanca handles the rest. 

When someone starts a transfer, a coordinator steps in, and if needed, it swaps the tokens into the right form using a decentralised exchange (DEX). Then, the Lanca Bridge locks the tokens on the starting blockchain, checks everything with secure messages, and releases matching tokens on the other side. 

This smooth system keeps wait times steady, no matter which blockchains are involved, unlike the wild delays of old bridges. By making every transfer feel the same across all networks, Lanca takes away the stress and confusion. The goal is to make moving stuff between blockchains so easy that users hardly notice the tech—it just works quietly in the background, letting them focus on what matters.

### Keeping Up with New Blockchains

The blockchain world moves fast, with new networks—like Layer-2s for speed or Layer-3s for special jobs—popping up all the time. Traditional bridges can't keep pace, often taking weeks or months to connect to these new systems, which slows down access to fresh opportunities. 

Lanca solves this by being super quick to adapt. Using its Concero Messaging V2 system, the Lanca Bridging Framework can set up Child Pools on any new blockchain in just hours, not weeks. This speed works in two ways: it can spread out to more and more blockchains, keeping up with the latest trends, and it can handle all kinds of digital items, from simple tokens to fancy financial tools. 

This means users can jump into new blockchain networks and use their stuff almost as soon as they're ready, giving Lanca a big advantage over slower bridges. By staying fast and flexible, Lanca makes sure it's always ready for the next big thing in blockchain, helping users stay ahead without the wait.

### Stopping Security Risks

Security is a huge weak spot for traditional bridges, which have lost tons of money to hackers because they pile up valuable stuff in one place or rely on shaky systems. 

Lanca tackles this with a strong, layered safety plan to protect users' money and trust. The Parent Pool uses a multi-signature trick, meaning multiple parties have to agree before anything moves, so no single person can mess things up. It gets regular safety checks to stay tough against attacks. 

For talking between blockchains—a spot where many bridges fail—Lanca uses Concero Messaging V2 and Chainlink's CCIP to make sure messages are safe and clear. It also needs multiple approvals for big moves and waits a bit before finishing them, giving time to spot anything fishy. 

The Rebalancing Agents have to put up their own money as a promise to behave, and if they don't, they lose it, keeping them honest. Plus, Lanca watches everything closely with monitoring tools. This all-around approach cuts down on weak spots, making Lanca a bridge people can rely on without worrying about losing their stuff to hackers.

## Wrapping It Up

The blockchain world is full of different networks, which is great for new ideas but tricky when you want to move things between them. Old bridges have had a tough time keeping up—they're risky, slow, confusing, wasteful with money, and can't grow fast enough. Even so, people are using them a lot, with more than half of a billion moving through them in every day, showing how much everyone wants this to work.

Lanca steps in with a fresh fix, using a dual setup, a main hub with smaller pools, and a clever way to keep money flowing where it's needed. It focuses on saving cash, staying super safe, growing quickly, making things easy for users, and keeping everything balanced—solving the main headaches of older bridges and making Lanca a leader in tying blockchains together.

As new networks keep showing up and the need to connect them grows, Lanca's ability to jump in fast and link them smoothly keeps it ahead of the pack. Looking forward, Lanca dreams of a world where all these blockchains work as one big, invisible system—something users don't have to concern about, just use. By caring more about what people get out of it than the nuts and bolts, Lanca not only fixes today's problems but also sets the stage for blockchain to become a normal, helpful part of life, turning big ideas into something real and useful.
