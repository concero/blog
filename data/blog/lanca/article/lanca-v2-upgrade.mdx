Lanca V2 transforms cross-chain transactions with four powerful features that eliminate complexity and put you in complete control. These smart upgrades address the most common frustrations users face when moving assets across different blockchains.

## Post-Bridge Sending: One Transaction, Multiple Actions

Traditional cross-chain transfers require multiple steps: bridge your assets, wait for confirmation, then manually send them to your intended destination. Lanca V2 eliminates this tedious process by allowing you to send your bridged or swapped assets directly to any wallet address or ENS name immediately after the transaction completes.

This streamlined approach is perfect for various scenarios. Send cryptocurrency gifts directly to friends or family members without them knowing your wallet address. Move assets between your different wallets seamlessly, whether you're organising your portfolio or managing multiple accounts for different purposes.

</div>

The feature supports both traditional wallet addresses and human-readable ENS names, making transactions more intuitive and reducing errors from copying long address strings. By combining bridging and sending into one operation, you save on gas fees, reduce transaction time, and eliminate the risk of forgetting to complete the final transfer step.

## Precision Inputs: Smart Recognition for Natural Commands

Calculating exact amounts for crypto transactions can be frustrating, especially when dealing with tokens that have multiple decimal places or when you want to use specific percentages of your holdings. Lanca V2 solves this with intelligent input recognition that understands how you naturally think about amounts.

  <img src="/static/images/lanca/article/lanca-v2-upgrade/transfer-type.png" alt="Precision Inputs" />
</div>

You just need to:

- Enter "$100" and Lanca converts this to the equivalent token amount at current market prices. 

- Simply type "50%" and the platform automatically calculates half of your available balance.

- Use shortcuts like "max" to utilise your entire balance, "half" for 50% of your holdings, or "minimum" for the smallest viable transaction amount.

This smart system reads your intent behind the numbers, making the platform accessible whether you're a DeFi expert or newcomer. No more manual calculations, no more worrying about decimal places, and no more failed transactions due to insufficient balance calculations. The platform handles all the complex math while you focus on your trading strategy.

## Slippage Controls: Precision Trading on Your Terms

Market volatility can turn profitable trades into disappointing outcomes when slippage isn't properly managed. Many platforms force users to choose from preset slippage options or guess at appropriate tolerances, often resulting in failed transactions or unexpected price impacts.

</div>

Lanca V2 puts you in the driver's seat with custom slippage controls. Set your maximum acceptable price movement based on your risk tolerance and current market conditions. Whether you're trading during stable periods with tight spreads or navigating volatile markets where prices move rapidly, you decide how much slippage is acceptable.

The platform provides real-time estimates of market impact, helping you make informed decisions about your slippage settings. This transparency ensures your trades execute exactly as planned, without surprises about final prices or transaction failures due to insufficient slippage allowance.

## Gas Token Visibility: Never Get Caught Short Again

One of the most frustrating experiences in DeFi is preparing a complex transaction only to discover you lack sufficient gas tokens at the final confirmation step. This common scenario wastes time, disrupts trading strategies, and often occurs at the worst possible moments.

Lanca V2 eliminates this problem by prominently displaying your gas token balances across all supported networks before you begin any transaction. See your ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, and other native token holdings at a glance, ensuring you have adequate funds to complete operations on each respective blockchain.

</div>

This proactive approach prevents failed transactions, saves valuable time, and provides complete confidence in your ability to execute cross-chain operations. You'll never again experience the disappointment of a perfectly planned trade failing due to insufficient gas funds.

Together, these features make Lanca V2 the most intuitive cross-chain platform available, transforming complex multi-blockchain operations into simple, predictable actions.
