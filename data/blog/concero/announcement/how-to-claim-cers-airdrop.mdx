## Introduction

We're thrilled to announce the development of the Concero Ecosystem Rewards Portal (CERP). designed to engage users with rewarding quests and product interactions within our ecosystem. This initiative aims to enhance user experience and attract more innovative products to integrate with Concero's cutting-edge infrastructure. Check out how many CERs (Concero Ecosystem Rewards Unit) you've been airdropped! We're offering a one-time retroactive claim for all your On-chain & Off-chain transactions you've done as a DeFi user. Connect your wallet, claim your CERs, and earn a multiplier for your transactions! Rewards Live on: http://app.concero.io/rewards

CERs will be used to determine your leaderboard ranking, where we will be creating tiers and giving out exclusive rewards no other Web3 Protocol has done before like Team retreat with Concero, Dine and Dash with the CEO, Concero Merch, more we can‚Äôt share yet ;) on a monthly basis to all our CERs holders, which will become key to decentralisation very down the line as we believe community is #1 for @concero_io and @lanca_io . It will help in decentralising Lanca in the near future.
