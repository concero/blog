## Abstract

We are very happy to announce the launch of Concero Hub and within this article we will cover what Concero Hub and CERs are.

## Introduction:

One of the core problems that any decentralised protocol faces is how to fairly track and reward protocol contributors/believers. We have had many different mechanics over the years, think ICO allocations, airdrops, etc. Each of these approaches have their own benefits and fallbacks, think Sybil, legality, unfair distribution, etc. However, it is vital for the project to get this right as the idea of rewarding contributors sits at the core of fundamental ethos upon which this industry was built. With Concero Hub and CERs, we are trying to build our own mechanics to attempt for a fair rewarding of protocol contributors.

## What are CERs?

CERs (abbreviated from Concero Ecosystem Rewards) are non-value-bearing tokens that account for and represent individual's contribution to the Concero protocol and ecosystem. The more a person contributes to the ecosystem through Concero Hub, the more CERs they will earn. These CERs can be used down the line to get rewards in different forms (ranging from monthly giveaways to airdrop allocations of Concero, Lanca and partner projects' tokens).

## Why do we need CERs?

There are many activities that contributors can perform that will help Concero protocol and ecosystem develop and grow. This ranges from participating in testing of new products/providing detailed feedback to participation in campaigns, joining the community team, and providing exposure to the protocol. These activities directly influence and contribute towards ensuring that we are building the best protocol we can and allow us to provide additional value to projects that choose to integrate us. This value can be provided by onboarding projects into the Concero Hub and CER ecosystem to test out their product, launch their product with campaigns and grow their community. This is done in a bid to attract high quality teams that want to build using Concero protocol and help them get ahead.

## What is Concero Hub?

Concero Hub is a native platform that allows users to earn CERs and help amplify Concero ecosystem and partner projects. Concero Hub will consist of three distinct sections:

1. Testing Portal ‚Äî a portal where you can try out new products developed by us or our partners and provide detailed feedback that helps developers build a better and more user focused products/protocols. Each testing activity will be incentivised with CERs and Testing Portal will go live in Q4 2024.
2. Rewards Portal ‚Äî a portal where you can participate in campaigns by performing on-chain and social quests to earn CERs. Rewards Portal is currently live at app.concero.io/rewards
3. Community Portal ‚Äî a place where you can apply to join the community team as a moderator, ambassador or a KOL. You will be incentivised to perform your duties and grow the Concero community with CERs. Community Portal will go live in Q4 2024.

All of the rewards and CER related activities will take place through Concero Hub as it will act as a central point in the ecosystem. CERs will also be earned through interacting and using partner protocols and projects.

## What can you do with CERs?

As mentioned before, CERs will be used for distributing rewards. Those projects who choose to participate within the Concero Hub and Ecosystem will provide a portion of their total supply towards rewarding Concero Hub users that interacted with their protocol. CERs will also be used to distribute Concero and Lanca tokens to the community. Additionally, you will be able to exchange CERs for physical and digital goods as well as experiences through the CER Store. We will also be running a monthly giveaway in which you can participate using CERs. In essence, by participating in Concero Hub and collecting CERs, you will be positioning yourself to benefit from the growth and development of Concero and its ecosystem.

## What is the future of CERs?
At the moment of writing this article, CERs are fully centralised and are controlled from our backend. Although we will not maliciously interfere with them, we do believe that it is important that we decentralise CERs and turn them into an on-chain token. We have come up with a 4 stage roadmap for decentralising CERs.

### Stage 1 (Fully Centralised system):

_Testing out the different portals and ways of making CERs and seeing what sticks:_

This is the current state of CERs. This is when we will be launching everything and seeing what works and what doesn't. We will be experimenting with a lot of different activities in order to find those that we will implement long term (i.e. the type of on-chain campaign). Keeping CERs centralised will allow us quick mobility in improving.

### Stage 2 (Partially On-Chain):

_CERs become an on-chain token which can be held in a wallet with a gift/sales tax to deter people from speculating and malicious activity._

- Tested actions that we want to implement long term become fully decentralised, you will have CERs minted for your action automatically on a smart contract.
- There is still a ‚Äúmint CER‚Äù function for the team in a smart contract, to have an ability to test out new types of activities and interactions quickly
- Concero Shop is expanded
- New activities are tried out and tested
- Allow users to propose new activities

In this iteration, we are bringing stuff on-chain and are becoming more decentralised and automated but we are still retaining an ability to mint CERs to test out new activities, however we will lose an ability to take CERs away.

### Stage 3 (Fully On-Chain but multi-sig):

_We take away 'mint CER' function from the smart contract, however, the team can in theory upgrade smart contracts to add it back in as it is controlled by a multi-sig_

- More tested tasks become on-chain
- First airdrop is distributed across CER holders
- Mint function is taken away and the team can only use the sales tax CERs to test out new interactions and activities
- Idea of seasons is introduced where we are able to control the inflation by (redenomination/reverse stock split type of mechanism)
- Allow other projects to create CER distribution channels based on their token commitment to the CER ecosystem

### Stage 4 (Fully On-Chain + DAO control):

_After Concero Token is launched, the control over the smart contract is given to the DAO and team can no longer add or take away functions at our will with multi-sig._

Final form of CERs where the control is fully given to the community through the DAO mechanism that is controlled by Concero Token Holders.

## Final Thoughts:

We are excited to be launching the CER ecosystem and Concero Hub as we believe that this will be a tremendous value add to the overall Concero Ecosystem. Concero Hub will be launching in Q4 2024 but you can already start accumulating CERs through the Rewards Portal.

It is important to note that when we launch on-chain CER tokens, there will be no team/investor or any type of allocation. The only way to mint or acquire CERs is through activities and it will stay that way.
