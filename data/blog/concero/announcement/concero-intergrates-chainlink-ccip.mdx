We're excited to announce that Concero has integrated [Chainlink CCIP](https://chain.link/cross-chain) ‚Äî the industry standard for secure cross-chain interoperability ‚Äî across Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, Polygon mainnets. We're leveraging CCIP's token transfer capabilities to facilitate highly secure cross-chain transactions, enabling Concero to provide users with a frictionless cross-chain experience.

We selected CCIP as our preferred interoperability solution because Chainlink has the most proven track record of maintaining the highest standard of security and reliability in the blockchain industry, with CCIP being the only interoperability solution achieving [Level-5 cross-chain security](https://blog.chain.link/five-levels-cross-chain-security/). Furthermore, CCIP is backed by the [Risk Management Network](https://blog.chain.link/ccip-mainnet-early-access/#risk-management-network) ‚Äî a separate, independent network that continually monitors and verifies cross-chain operations for suspicious activity. This additional layer of security is particularly important given historical industry exploits and the billions in user funds lost due to unreliable cross-chain infrastructure.

Thanks to its security-driven approach, Chainlink has built one of the largest ecosystems in the blockchain industry and is being established as the industry-standard blockchain connectivity standard within capital markets. Connecting Concero to the cross-chain DeFi ecosystem offers a multitude of growth opportunities that help Concero realize its vision and increase ecosystem adoption.

At Concero, our mission is to create DeFi products that truly meet our users' needs. We achieve this by offering a secure, decentralized application that provides seamless access to the DeFi ecosystem, regardless of the blockchain. Powered by the industry-standard Chainlink CCIP, Concero delivers enhanced risk management, liquidity maximization, reliable transaction execution, and more. Our commitment to leveraging highly secure technology ensures that our users experience the best of DeFi ‚Äî with confidence and ease.

In order to help secure our cross-chain token transfers, we needed access to a highly secure and reliable interoperability solution. After reviewing various solutions, we integrated Chainlink CCIP because it provides a multitude of important benefits and features, such as:

- **Defense-in-depth security** ‚Äî CCIP's consensus and interoperability layer is powered by Chainlink decentralized oracle networks, which have already secured tens of billions of dollars for smart contracts and enabled over $12 trillion in onchain transaction value. CCIP also features additional layers of protection and reliability via the Risk Management Network and [Smart Execution](https://blog.chain.link/ccip-mainnet-early-access/#smart-execution).
- **Simplified Token Transfers** ‚Äî CCIP features a plug-and-play solution consisting of audited token pool contracts that handle the complexity of burning and minting or locking and unlocking tokens across chains. CCIP token transfers also have additional security features like rate limits, and enable ecosystem partners to easily build new capabilities around a supported token via a single CCIP interface.
- **Programmable Token Transfers** ‚Äî CCIP messages are programmable, meaning token transfers and arbitrary data transfers can be one atomic transaction. This enables instructions to be passed in the data payload regarding what to do with the tokens once they arrive at the destination chain.
- **Extendable and future-proof** ‚Äî CCIP is built to support continuous updates, such as the integration of new blockchains, the introduction of advanced functionalities, and the addition of other defense-in-depth approaches to security. Thus, integrating CCIP eliminates future switching costs should new cross-chain functionalities be required.

This integration follows us joining Chainlink BUILD, which provides enhanced access to Chainlink services and expert technical support.

‚ÄúWe have selected industry-standard Chainlink CCIP to be the cornerstone of our cross-chain infrastructure. Security is crucial for the Concero platform, and CCIP stands as the most secure cross-chain solution available. This decision was a clear choice that will elevate Concero to the next level.‚Äù ‚Äî Andy Bohutsky, Co-founder, CEO of Concero.
