We are excited to announce that Concero has become a member of Alastria, Spain's leading blockchain consortium. This strategic partnership marks an important step in our mission to enhance blockchain interoperability and drive innovation in the Spanish technology ecosystem.

Alastria, Spain's foremost blockchain consortium, brings together industry leaders committed to developing and implementing blockchain solutions. As a new member, Concero will contribute its expertise in cross-chain communication and blockchain interoperability to advance the consortium's initiatives.

Our collaboration with Alastria will focus on three key areas:

‚ÄúInteroperability is the bridge connecting blockchains, applications, and traditional systems. By 2025, it will form the foundation of modern finance, fostering better collaboration and expanding access to more innovative solutions. At Concero, we are dedicated to leading this transformation alongside the members of Alastria,‚Äù says Andy Bohutsky, CEO of Concero.
