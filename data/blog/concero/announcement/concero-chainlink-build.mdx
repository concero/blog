We're excited to announce that Concero is officially joining the [Chainlink BUILD program](https://chain.link/economics/build-program). As a part of BUILD, we aim to accelerate ecosystem growth and the long-term adoption of cross-chain applications by gaining enhanced access to Chainlink's industry-leading oracle services and technical support, as well as incentivizing greater cryptoeconomic security, in exchange for a commitment to provide network fees and other benefits to the Chainlink community and service providers, including stakers.

Our participation in BUILD provides the added benefits of priority support from the Chainlink ecosystem, streamlined integration and development, and stronger incentive alignment between the Chainlink and Concero communities.

We're confident that through enhanced support, secure offchain services, and the backing of Chainlink's vibrant community, we can accelerate awareness of Concero and realize the adoption of a seamless and intuitive cross-chain DeFi ecosystem that abstracts away blockchain and wallet infrastructure from users.

## Concero: Building a Seamless Cross-Chain Super dApp
Concero aims to provide users with an easy-to-use, secure, and decentralized application that provides seamless access to the DeFi ecosystem, no matter the blockchain.

Concero's products are guided by three North Star principles: security, speed, and ease of use. Currently, Concero's hallmark products are its cross-chain staking and DEX aggregator. Both are integrated with top blockchains and applications to offer users optionality, choice of yield, and all-in-one functionality.

The end goal of Concero is to develop a ‚Äúsuper app‚Äù that will cater to the needs of the vast majority of crypto users ‚Äî acting as the de facto entrance point for new users to join the world of DeFi. To do so, we plan to use cutting-edge technological developments in Web3 such as account abstraction and Chainlink CCIP to help provide a frictionless experience.

## Why We Joined Chainlink BUILD
Concero joined BUILD to maximize the benefits of security and reliability that Chainlink's oracle infrastructure provides. Specifically, as part of BUILD, Concero will receive key benefits, including access to and integration of Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which will sit at the core of Concero's cross-chain product offerings. Concero will also receive access to new Chainlink product alpha and beta releases, among other benefits.

In exchange for these services, Concero will make 4% of its native token supply available to Chainlink service providers, including stakers, over time. These mutually aligned economic incentives enable both communities to support one another.

‚ÄúOne of Concero's North Star principles is security, and using CCIP is an absolute no-brainer when you're looking for the most secure cross-chain solution. Chainlink CCIP will serve as the core building block of our cross-chain infrastructure, and joining Chainlink BUILD helps speed up our technological development so that we can ship faster while staying secure. As part of the BUILD program, we look forward to continuing our collaboration together and we welcome the passionate Chainlink community into the Concero ecosystem.‚Äù ‚Äî Andy Bohutsky and Oleg Kron Co-Founders of Concero.
