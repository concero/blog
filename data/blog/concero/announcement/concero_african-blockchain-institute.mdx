Concero is proud to announce our strategic partnership with the African Blockchain Institute (ABI), marking a significant milestone in our mission to advance blockchain adoption globally. As a participant in Chainlink Labs' BUILD program, we are committed to addressing the technological gaps in Africa's blockchain ecosystem through our expertise in interoperability and cross-chain solutions.

Our partnership with ABI focuses on three fundamental areas: technical infrastructure development, educational capacity building, and ecosystem growth. We will leverage our Chainlink-powered infrastructure to provide secure and efficient blockchain interoperability solutions, establishing a robust technical foundation for Africa's emerging blockchain landscape. This infrastructure is essential for overcoming the current challenges of fragmented networks that hinder innovation and adoption across different blockchains.

Our CEO, Andy Bohutsky, shares his vision for this collaboration: “Africa's potential for blockchain-driven transformation is immense. Partnering with the African Blockchain Institute allows us to build bridges — between blockchains, people, and ideas — and drive inclusion and empowerment across the continent.” 

This vision perfectly aligns with our technical architecture, which utilises Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to enable secure cross-chain communications. We are working closely with ABI to ensure our technology solutions are effectively localised and implemented within the African context. Kayode Babarinde, Executive Director of ABI, emphasises our shared vision: “This collaboration equips Africa's blockchain ecosystem with the resources needed to thrive. By combining education, innovation, and interoperability, we aim to foster sustainable growth and transformative impact.” 

Through this partnership, we are combining our technical expertise in blockchain interoperability with ABI's deep understanding of regional needs and educational frameworks. This collaboration will enable African developers and businesses to participate fully in the global blockchain ecosystem while developing solutions that address local challenges.
