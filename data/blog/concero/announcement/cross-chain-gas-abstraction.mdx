## Introduction
Cross-chain transactions have long been a challenge due to gas fees and the need for users to hold native tokens on both the source and destination chains. Concero's Gas Abstraction aims to revolutionize this process, making it seamless and user-friendly.

### The Problem: Insufficient Gas on Destination Chains
One of the primary reasons users abandon cross-chain transactions is the lack of sufficient gas on the destination chain. Paying gas fees in multiple tokens can be cumbersome and costly. Concero addresses this pain point by abstracting gas payments.

### Gas Abstraction v1: Using Chainlink Price Feeds
In the initial version of Gas Abstraction, Concero leverages Chainlink Price Feeds to determine the value of LINK (used for Chainlink fees). Instead of requiring users to hold LINK tokens, a portion of their existing tokens is used to cover these fees. This simplifies the process and eliminates the need for users to manage multiple token balances.

### Exciting Features in Gas Abstraction v2
Concero is eagerly anticipating Gas Abstraction v2, which promises even more convenience:
- **Full Gas Abstraction:** In addition to covering destination chain fees, v2 will also include the source chain transaction. Users won't need any ETH to initiate swaps or transfers. This groundbreaking feature streamlines cross-chain interactions further.

## Conclusion
Concero's Gas Abstraction is a game-changer for cross-chain transactions. By abstracting gas payments and simplifying the process, it opens up new possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain interoperability.

Stay tuned for more updates as Concero continues to innovate in the crypto space!
