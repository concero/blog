Concero announces a strategic partnership with SettleX, marking a significant step toward institutional-grade cross-chain infrastructure. SettleX will integrate Concero Motherboard as the foundation for its clearing and settlement operations, becoming one of the first applications purpose-built on the Motherboard platform.

### Introduction

SettleX chose Concero Motherboard to power its cross-chain settlement infrastructure, combining two complementary approaches to institutional blockchain adoption. Concero provides the underlying cross-chain execution layer, handling secure asset transfers and liquidity routing across multiple blockchains. SettleX builds specialised clearing logic on top, aggregating flows between participants and settling only net positions rather than individual transactions.

This integration allows SettleX to operate as a chain-agnostic clearing layer without managing separate bridge integrations for each blockchain.

The architecture separates concerns effectively. Concero handles cross-chain complexity and security at the infrastructure level. SettleX implements domain-specific logic for clearing, netting, and settlement operations. This division enables both platforms to optimise for their respective functions while creating a complete solution for institutional cross-chain operations.

### Industry Impact

This partnership demonstrates a new model for institutional blockchain infrastructure. Rather than building monolithic systems that handle both cross-chain execution and clearing logic, specialised layers can be composed to address specific institutional needs. SettleX's netting approach can reduce bridging costs by up to 90% for high-volume participants, while Concero's infrastructure ensures these operations remain secure and operationally simple.

The combination addresses two critical barriers to institutional adoption: cost efficiency and operational complexity. As market makers, liquidity providers, and other professional participants increase blockchain activity, purpose-built clearing infrastructure integrated with robust cross-chain platforms may define the next generation of institutional settlement systems. This partnership provides a template for how specialised financial infrastructure can be built on general cross-chain foundations.

### About Concero

Concero builds cross-chain infrastructure focused on security, efficiency, and developer experience. Concero Motherboard provides a modular architecture that enables applications to compose their own interoperability stack by selecting independent verifiers and relayers per transaction. This design eliminates vendor lock-in, allowing developers to access liquidity and execute transactions across chains without depending on restrictive bridge integrations.

The platform prioritises high security while supporting diverse use cases and giving applications full control over their cross-chain operations and distribution.

### About SettleX

SettleX operates as a clearing layer that aggregates cross-chain flows between institutional participants. Rather than bridging each transaction individually, SettleX uses multilateral netting to settle only the net difference between participants. This approach can reduce bridging costs by up to 90% while maintaining compliance readiness and privacy features for institutional users. SettleX serves market makers, liquidity providers, solvers, and other high-volume participants.
