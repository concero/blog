Concero's mission is to reduce the dominance of Centralised Exchanges (CEXes) within the world of crypto. We have seen what can happen if you put too much trust into centralised entities and unfortunately, we have seen it within the world of crypto (FTX collapse). This threat is well known within the industry but people are still using them (90%+ of all swaps are done on centralised exchanges). The main reason behind it — it is just easier and more convenient to use.

DeFi is no doubt a revolutionary space but at the moment the barrier of entry is just way too high and a majority of users feel overwhelmed trying to get their head around it. And who can blame them? It is confusing.

There are a total of 5 activities that 90% of average users need in their crypto journey:

1. Swap
2. Earn (Yield)
3. Track the performance of their assets
4. Discover new opportunities
5. On-ramp/Off-ramp

It is no coincidence that these are the activities that Centralised Exchanges are catering for. At Concero, we are building a decentralised, non-custodial and easy to use alternative. Let’s break it down:

### Swap

With a swap tab you get access to a cross-chain decentralised exchange aggregator. Not only does a user get access to a large array of tokens across tens of different blockchains but they also get access to maximum on-chain liquidity. Liquidity is a big concern when talking about decentralised exchanges through aggregation we can maximise it and minimise slippage. In addition, the UI is heavily inspired by centralised exchanges that makes it easier for people who decide to switch from centralised to decentralised solutions to find their way around.

### Earn

Earn tab leads to our staking aggregator, where we aggregate staking opportunities such as lending protocols, POS blockchains and providing liquidity into decentralised exchanges. Users are able to navigate around different options with all the data at their fingertips helping them make a smart investment decision and execute it within one platform. Furthermore, with the addition of compound staking, users are going to be able to discover and execute complicated compounding strategies quickly and easily.

### Track

Portfolio tracker is an imperative part of Concero. Keeping track of the performance of your assets is key in order to make smart investment decisions. Though there is not much we can innovate on with regards to this feature but building a useful and simple user interface for portfolio tracking is a challenging task. We are working hard on ensuring that features that we deliver are refined and provide value to our users.

### Discover

Finding new opportunities is what the crypto industry is about. Which tokens are pumping, dumping or stagnant? What staking opportunities are out there worth looking into? Which projects have had an influx of users or token holders? These questions and more will be answered within our Discover page. Giving people such data is a key feature in boosting value that we provide to the user. Although it will not be an analytics platform, it will be a starting point in finding the next investment opportunity.

### On-ramping/Off-ramping (crypto to fiat and fiat to crypto)

This is one of the biggest reasons why people prefer Centralised exchanges and a big challenge to solve in a decentralised manner. Initially, we will be partnering up with on-ramp/off-ramp solutions such as On-ramper but our vision extends beyond that. We are working on creating a completely decentralised peer-to-peer protocol which will allow users to on-ramp and off-ramp easily, with no KYC or restrictions. We have been in talks with universities and industry experts to devise a plan on how to approach this challenge. Although it is a long way ahead, this will be the biggest innovation to come out of Concero. We will post a completely separate article on our plans regarding this at a later date but if you or someone that you know is interested in working on this problem with us please reach out!

## Design Ethos

With key features out of the way, it is important to talk about our UX/UI. We take this very seriously as it is one of the keys to making DeFi accessible. At the moment, we are still iterating and will continue to do so indefinitely but we have decided to take big inspiration from Centralised Exchanges. Our mentality behind this decision is simple — they have spent thousands of hours and millions of dollars perfecting it so in true crypto fashion — we are forking it. With time we will be making improvements to go beyond the designs of centralised exchanges but as it stands right now this is our approach.

## The three pillars

![Concero Mission and Plans](/static/images/concero/article/concero-mission-plans/fig2.webp)

When it comes to any decision that we make within Concero we evaluate it to see if it improves one of the three pillars:

1. Ease of use
2. Quick and cheap
3. Safe

In our opinion, these are the three most important aspects that will improve accessibility of DeFi. Let's break down our ideas on how we can improve these things. Bear in mind that these are going to change over time so keep an eye out on our medium and twitter where we will be updating you guys on it.

## Making Concero easy to use

There are a lot of things we can do but the ones we are focusing on right now are — good mobile version so people are able to interact and perform transactions from their phone easily albeit with reduced complexity than the desktop version. In addition, we are testing gasless transactions so a user will be able to pay for gas in any tokens and not hold native tokens of blockchains that they interact with.

We will also include the functionality of signing in with Web 2 gateways (email and password, google login, etc) and a wallet would be created on the behalf of the user that they will hold keys to via web3auth. This will make onboarding a lot easier for users coming from a traditional Web 2 world but will not impede on the decentralisation and self custody aspect of Concero.

Lastly, we plan to introduce a simple version and advanced versions of the platform to cater to both more and less experienced users without underwhelming one or overwhelming the other.

## Making Concero quick and cheap

As big fans of L2 protocols we want to make it seamless for our users to onboard onto L2 swap there and off-board into L1 when they want to hold or stake. It will not only increase the speed of transactions but will also drastically reduce gas fees for our users. This is easier said than done and at the moment we are still in the idea stage of this feature. Nevertheless, finding a way to make this process seamless will be a big step forward for us and the whole DeFi ecosystem.

## Making Concero safe

Safety of one's assets is high on the priority list for users and this is why we are committed to making sure that our users are safe with us. Not only are we fully committed to decentralisation and self-custody but we are always integrating safety features into Concero. This includes our partnership with InsurAce that allows our users to insure their cross-chain swaps for a peace of mind. We are also working with InsurAce to develop a product that will allow our users to take out insurance policies on protocols that they stake their assets in. In addition, we will be implementing safety scores from independent projects to allow our users to assess the risk involved in any transaction that they are performing. These and many other safety features are targeted towards giving our users confidence in their choices and in the safety of their assets.

## Epilogue

To conclude, we have big aspirations and a lot of hard work cut out for us but we are dedicated to delivering on these promises and with your support we are certain that we can do it. Please share any feedback you have for the team and please don't forget to follow us on [X](https://x.com/concero_io) and check out our [Website](https://concero.io). The Discord community will be launched soon and we look forward to having closer chats with you there!
