# Introduction

In any cross-chain communication protocol, the mechanism that propagates messages between networks is fundamental. 

In Concero V2, this vital role is performed by [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi/)'s operators known as relayers. However, unlike traditional systems where relayers can be a point of centralisation or a security bottleneck, Concero V2 streamlines the relayer's function. Relayers in Concero V2 are highly efficient components within an advanced dual-layer security model, built to help messages get through without serving as the single source of trust.

This article explores the critical role and operational framework of relayers within Concero V2, highlighting how their design is foundational to achieving secure, rapid, and truly decentralised interoperability.

# Understanding Symbiotic: The Economic Backbone

Before diving into the specifics of Concero's relayers, it is essential to understand the economic security layer that underpins their integrity: [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi/). 

[Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi/) is a permissionless and modular restaking protocol that functions as a thin coordination layer for shared security. Its flexible design allows networks like Concero to define their own restaking rules and select their own node operators.

The system involves two key participants:

- **Restakers:** are participants, such as individual token holders, institutions, or liquid restaking protocols, who seek to earn rewards by providing their assets as a stake. To do so, they deposit funds into vaults. Then, these vaults are managed by Curators, who are responsile for making all delegation decisions for the assets held within them,
- **Operators:** These are the node operators (in Concero's case, the relayers) who use the delegated collateral from curators to secure the network and perform their duties.

This model creates a highly capital-efficient ecosystem where a broad base of assets secures the network, rather than relying solely on the operators' own capital. This foundation of shared economic security is what enables Concero to build a trustless and scalable relayer network.

# The Dual-Relayer Architecture: Flexibility and Security

With the economic foundation established, we can explore Concero V2's flexible dual-relayer architecture, which is designed to handle different types of cross-chain messages securely and efficiently.

**Relayer A (Mandatory Infrastructure):** This is the primary relayer essential for all core operations of the protocol. It is the workhorse of the system, with a clear and crucial set of responsibilities:

- **Event Monitoring:** It constantly watches for and captures events emitted by the on-chain ConceroRouter contracts whenever a user initiates a cross-chain transaction.
- **Verification Initiation:** Upon capturing an event, Relayer A forwards the message to the Master Chain (currently Arbitrum One) to trigger a cryptographic verification process via Chainlink Functions. This step is non-negotiable and secures all message types.
- **Report Processing and Transmission:** After Chainlink Functions generates a verifiable, tamper-proof report‚Äîcomplete with cryptographic signatures from the participating oracle nodes‚ÄîRelayer A captures and decodes it. It then transmits this secure report along with the transaction data to the destination chain for final on-chain authentication and message execution.

**Relayer B (Optional Security Layer):** This relayer serves as an additional consensus mechanism, recommended for high-value transactions where an extra layer of validation is desired. It works in parallel with Relayer A, capturing the same source chain event and transmitting a confirmation directly to the destination chain. This layer also supports the integration of arbitrary decentralised technology, where other providers (e.g., Chainlink CCIP) can act as the message relayer.

# The Cohort System: A Framework for Fairness and Reliability

![Cohort System](/static/images/concero/article/symbiotic-relayers-concero-v2/cohort-system.png)

A key innovation within Concero V2 is the organisation of relay operators into a **cohort-based system**. Instead of having all relayers compete in a single pool‚Äîa setup that often concentrates activity around the top performers‚Äîour protocol mathematically assigns operators to distinct cohorts. This design delivers two main advantages:

1. **Fair Decentralisation and Reward Sharing:** By restricting fee competition to within each cohort, the system ensures rewards are distributed more evenly. This prevents a small number of high-performance nodes from dominating and encourages a broader, more diverse set of operators to participate.
2. **Continuous Availability and Redundancy:** The cohort system inherently builds resilience. Cohort sizes can be adjusted on the fly to maintain an optimal balance between security and efficiency. If one operator in a cohort goes offline, the remaining members immediately take over message processing, keeping the network running without interruption and avoiding any single point of failure.

# The Dual-Layer Security Framework: Guaranteeing Relayer Integrity

While relayers are responsible for message transmission, their integrity is guaranteed by a broader, dual-layer security framework that synergistically combines conclusive cryptographic proof with the powerful economic accountability provided by Symbiotic.

### Layer 1: Cryptographic Verification via Chainlink Functions

Concero V2 never relies solely on the honesty of a relayer. Every message forwarded by Relayer A *must* be accompanied by a valid, cryptographically signed verification report from the Chainlink Decentralised Oracle Network (DON). This "dual verification" mechanism is the first and most critical layer of security. It ensures that even a compromised relayer cannot forge a message or execute a fraudulent transaction, as it would lack the required cryptographic proof. The Chainlink Functions DON, consisting of four independent nodes, requires a consensus from at least three nodes to validate a report, providing reliable and decentralised validation that is resistant to tampering.

### Layer 2: Applying Symbiotic for Economic Accountability

This is where Concero leverages the power of the Symbiotic framework to enforce honest and performant behaviour from its relayers.

- **Staked Collateral and Slashing:** To participate in the Concero network, all relay operators must secure delegated stake from Symbiotic's curators. This stake acts as a financial bond, and it is subject to automated slashing penalties for non-performance (e.g., a cohort failing to relay a message in a timely manner) or malicious actions. The threat of losing this staked capital makes dishonest behaviour economically costly and unviable.
- **Cost Efficiency:** The core Symbiotic contracts are deployed on Ethereum, and Concero V2 is designed to minimise interactions with them, primarily limiting them to exceptional cases like slashing requests. This minimalist approach to state changes dramatically reduces operational gas costs.
- **Rapid Challenge Period:** A significant innovation enabled by this dual-layer approach is the near-instant challenge period of 10-20 seconds. Because Chainlink Functions provide immediate cryptographic proof, the system can bypass the week-long challenge periods common in purely economic security models. This enhances capital efficiency for operators and improves the overall scalability of the network.

# A New Standard for Interoperability

The Concero V2 relayer marks a significant evolution in cross-chain protocol design. It is intentionally engineered to be a vehicle for transmission, not a source of trust. By offloading the heavy burden of verification, our relayers are free to operate as highly efficient and scalable components. This deliberate separation of duties is what makes the relayer a core of Concero's performance, enabling the rapid and cost-effective communication required for a truly unified blockchain future.
