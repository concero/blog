# Introduction

As a flagship participant in the Chainlink BUILD program, Concero has developed a fully decentralised cross-chain messaging protocol that enables secure message transfers between blockchain networks. Currently, Concero V1 powers Lanca, our decentralised cross-chain bridge for bridging and DEX aggregation across multiple networks. 

To advance our mission to unify the world's blockchain ecosystem, we have developed Concero Messaging V2, which represents the next evolution in cross-chain interoperation technology. Concero V2 connects blockchain networks more securely and rapidly than ever before. Also, Concero V2 empowers developers to build cross-chain applications with uncompromising security standards and complete decentralisation. 

We're excited to welcome everyone to join the Concero Messaging V2 public testnet. This release gives testers early access to experience the enhanced capabilities and performance of our messaging protocol before the mainnet launch.

This tutorial will guide you through step-by-step instructions on how to test Concero Messaging V2.

# Before you start testing Concero V2

To unify the world's blockchain ecosystem, Concero V2 is designed with an innovative architecture that allows it to connect with any blockchain network. During the testnet phase, you'll be able to test this capability by interacting with multiple testnet networks and transferring tCERO token between multiple testnet networks.

To participate in the testnet, there will be several prerequisites that you need to prepare, including installing a non-custodial wallet and adding testnet networks to your wallet.

## Install Non-custodial Wallet
*(Please skip this step if you already have Metamask installed)*

For the best testing experience, we recommend using MetaMask as it provides the flexibility to easily add and connect to any testnet blockchain network you need to test with.

For Metamask wallet installation instructions, please visit [our guide](https://www.blog.concero.io/blog/concero/article/metamask-installation). 

## Add Custom Testnet Networks to Your wallet
*(Please skip this step if you already know how add a custom network)*

For detailed instructions on how to add a custom network to your wallet, please visit [our guide](https://www.blog.concero.io/blog/concero/article/add-custom-network-tutorial).

## Get native gas token for testnet networks

As you will be interacting with multiple testnet networks, you will need to get the native gas token for each network.

Usually, you can get the native gas token for free from the testnet faucet. We have prepared a list of testnet networks with a faucet link for your convenience.

Please find the faucet link for your interested testnet network in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e0W0ZwgY_Bq-YDUk6JZHfdpcVYxqrvIS60gSCnoDeTg/edit?gid=1753051773#gid=1753051773g), and follow the faucet's instructions to get the native gas token.

If you can not get the native gas token on your preferred network, please head to our Testnet channel on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/lanca), and Concero team and the community will help you out.

# How to Test Concero Messaging V2? 

## 1. Visit the Concero Testnet page and connect your wallet

Head to the [Concero Messaging V2 Testnet](https://testnet.concero.io/) page and click on "Connect wallet".

![Concero V2 Testnet](/static/images/concero/article/concero-v2-tutorial/8-testnet-page.jpg)

*In some cases, the page will ask you to add the ApeChain Curtis once clicking Connect Wallet, please approve the request.*

A prompt will appear to ask for your approval to connect your wallet, click on "Connect".

## 2. Understand the Concero V2 testnet interface

Once connected, you will see a user interface as below, with several useful information that are highlighted in the red boxes.

They include:

- **The amount of tCERO testnet token** in your wallet on the connected testnet network (in this image, it is Ethereum Sepolia testnet)
- **The amount of the native gas token** in your wallet on the connected testnet network (in this image, it is ETH on Ethereum Sepolia testnet)
- **Source Chain**: the network you want to send the tCERO token (in this image, it is Ethereum Sepolia testnet)
- **Destination Chain**: the network you want to receive the tCERO token (in this image, it is Arbitrum Sepolia testnet)

## 3. Interact with the Concero V2 testnet interface

In this example, we will show you how to send tCERO token from Ethereum Sepolia testnet to Arbitrum Sepolia testnet.

Before doing that, you need to get the tCERO tokens from our faucet, please follow the steps below:

1. Click on the (+) button on the top right side of the interface.
2. A dashboard will appear with a list of supported tested networks. You can select any network you want to get the tCERO tokens. Here, we selected Ethereum Sepolia testnet.
3. Then, a prompt will appear as *"Adding token"*, you will need to wait for a few seconds. After that, it will automatically close the prompt and tCERO will be sent to your requested network.

Notes:

In some cases, you will see the message **"Error, please try again"** on the prompt as below. Please try to get tCERO from other networks or try it later, our faucet might be over-requested at that time. 

We are working hard to increase the capacity of the faucet. Thanks for your understanding and patience.

To check your tCERO balance on the requested network, please do as below:

1. Click on the "Source Chain" dropdown menu
2. Then, you will see the tCERO balance on all the supported tested networks.

## 4. Send tCERO token from Source Chain to Destination Chain

Once you have the tCERO tokens on your wallet, you can now start testing the Concero V2 messaging protocol.

**One more note, please make sure you have enough gas token on the source chain for initiating the transaction.**

### 4.1 Select the Source Chain and Destination Chain

Here, we choose Ethereum Seppolia as Source chain and Arbitrum Sepolia as Destination chain. 

Enter the amount of tCERO you want to send. Then, click "Begin Swap" to initiate the transaction.

### 4.2 Confirm the transaction (a two-step process)

Once you click on "Begin Swap", a prompt will appear to ask for your confirmation. Click "Confirm" to proceed the allowance process.

**Please be patient as the transaction might take a few seconds to complete.**

![Concero V2 Testnet](/static/images/concero/article/concero-v2-tutorial/15-confirm-sending.jpg)

Once the Allowance is done, you will see the interface changing as below. Another prompt will appear to ask for your confirmation again. Click "Confirm" to proceed.

**Please be patient as the transaction might take a few seconds to complete.**

### 4.3 Check the transaction status

Once the transaction is completed, you will see the transaction status as below. 

Congratulations! You have successfully sent tCERO token from Ethereum Sepolia testnet to Arbitrum Sepolia testnet.

Don't forget to claim your CERs by clicking on the "Claim" button.

![Concero V2 Testnet](/static/images/concero/article/concero-v2-tutorial/17-success-tx.jpg)

Also, don't forget to share your successful transaction on X to have a more chance to get more CERs.

### 4.4 Try swapping from other networks

You can try swapping from other networks by repeating the steps above, by selecting different Source and Destination chains.

If the selected testnet networks are not supported with your Metamask wallet, please add the testnet networks before starting the swap.

The name of the supported testnet can be found on the balance dashboard, then search for the network name on the [Chainid website](https://chainid.network/), and add the testnet network to your wallet. 

Please visit [our guide](https://www.blog.concero.io/blog/concero/article/add-custom-network-tutorial) for detailed instructions on adding a custom network.
