# Introduction

As a flagship participant in the Chainlink BUILD program, Concero has developed a fully decentralised cross-chain messaging protocol that enables secure message transfers between blockchain networks. Currently, Concero V1 powers Lanca, our decentralised cross-chain bridge for bridging and DEX aggregation across multiple networks. 

To advance our mission to unify the world's blockchain ecosystem, we have developed Concero Messaging V2, which represents the next evolution in cross-chain interoperation technology. Concero V2 connects blockchain networks more securely and rapidly than ever before. Also, Concero V2 empowers developers to build cross-chain applications with uncompromising security standards and complete decentralisation. 

We're excited to welcome everyone to join the Concero Messaging V2 public testnet. This release gives testers early access to experience the enhanced capabilities and performance of our messaging protocol before the mainnet launch.

This tutorial will guide you through step-by-step instructions on how to test Concero Messaging V2.

# Before you start testing Concero V2

## Install Non-custodial Wallet
*(Please skip this step if you already have Metamask installed)*

Concero V2 is designed with an innovative architecture that allows it to connect with any blockchain network. During the testnet phase, you'll be able to test this capability by interacting with multiple testnet networks.

For the best testing experience, we recommend using MetaMask as it provides the flexibility to easily add and connect to any testnet blockchain network you need to test with.

For Metamask wallet installation instructions, please visit [our guide](https://www.blog.concero.io/blog/lanca/article/metamask-installation). 

## Add Testnet Networks by using Chainlist

As memtioned above, Concero V2 aims to unify the world's blockchain ecosystem. Therefore, in this testnet phase, testers will be able to test the Concero V2 messaging protocol by transferring tCERO token between multiple testnet networks.

There are two ways to add testnet networks to your Metamask wallet: 

1. Automatically by using Chainlist
2. Manually by adding the network information

### 1. Automatically by using Chainid/ Chainlist

**Chainlist** is a open-source platform helping users to add mainnet and testnet networks to their wallets.

Head to [Chainid website](https://chainid.network/) and you will see a list of supported networks, including both mainnet and testnet networks. For Concero V2 public testnet, you will mainly interact with testnet networks. 

Please **Connect your wallet** to for further steps.

![Chainid](/static/images/concero/article/concero-v2-tutorial/1-chainid-connect.jpg)

In this tutorial, you will be instructed to add a Arbitrum Sepolia testnet to your wallet. You can do the same for other testnet networks.

In the search bar, type in "Arbitrum", then it will show a list of supported testnet networks related to Arbitrum. 

Select Arbitrum Sepolia testnet, and click on "Add Chain" button.

![Chainid](/static/images/concero/article/concero-v2-tutorial/2-add-arbitrum.jpg)

A prompt will appear to ask for your approval to add "Arbitrum Sepolia" network to your wallet. Click on "Approve".

![Chainid](/static/images/concero/article/concero-v2-tutorial/3-approve-chain.jpg)

### Notes:

You can also use [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) to add testnet networks to your wallet. However, we found that there might be some issues with adding testnet networks to Metamask using Chainlist. 

If you can not add the network automatically, please add the network manually as per the steps below.

### 2. Manually by adding the network information

For some reasons, you may not be able to add the network automatically. In this case, you can manually add the network information.

Click to the Metamask extension icon on the top right corner of your browser. Then chose the Network management tab (the red box in the image below).

![Metamask](/static/images/concero/article/concero-v2-tutorial/4-change-testnet.jpg)

To see testnet networks, please enable the "Show test networks" option. Then click on "Add a custom network". 

![Metamask](/static/images/concero/article/concero-v2-tutorial/5-show-testnet.jpg)

A prompt will appear to ask for network information, including: Network name, RPC URL, Chain ID, Currency Symbol, Block Explorer URL.

![Metamask](/static/images/concero/article/concero-v2-tutorial/6-custom-network.jpg)

For these information, you can find it on [Chainid website](https://chainid.network/).

For example, for Arbitrum Sepolia testnet, you can click to that network and find the required information. You can copy the information and paste into the custom network prompt. Once finished, click on "Save" button.

![Chainid](/static/images/concero/article/concero-v2-tutorial/7-network-information.jpg)

## Get native gas token for testnet networks

As you will be interacting with multiple testnet networks, you will need to get the native gas token for each network.

Usually, you can get the native gas token for free from the testnet faucet. We have prepared a list of testnet networks with a faucet link for your convenience.

Please visit [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s6VH4EITpavCIdjaJUGs489cmzpDug_hGEGTnxzWYfk/edit?usp=sharing), copy the link in the "Faucet" column and request for the native gas token.

There might be some issues with the faucet links. You can search on Google for the latest faucet links for the preferred network.

Also, if you can not get the native gas token on your preferred network, please head to our Testnet channel on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/lanca), and Concero team and the community will help you out.
